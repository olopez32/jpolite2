<h4>A Tale of Two JS Files</h4>
<p>Two JavaScript files are provide to build a working JPolite system:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>jpolite.core.js</b> - the abstract foundation of a tab-navigated portal framework, with internal data structures and methods.</li>
	<li><b>jpolite.ext.js</b> - all the feature initialization and customization code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally you don't need to touch the core, customizing the ext part is (hopefully) enough to tailor JPolite for your needs.</p>

<h4>Feature Customization</h4>
<p>Here's a brief list of features you can customize in <b>jpolite.ext.js</b>:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Custom jQuery Plugins</b> - you can simple add them via <b>$.fn.extend</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Live Event Handlers</b> - Simply call jquery function <b>live</b> to register you custom live event handlers. You can put all such
	calls in function myLiveEvents for easier management.</li>
	<li><b>Custom Events</b> - Simply call <b>$.bindEvent</b> to register a series of custom events and handlers into the JPolite system. Note
	that $.bindEvent is a JPolite method which is used to register global events not applicable to specific DOM elements. For DOM elements,
	please use jQuery's $.bind method instead. You can put all such calls in function <b>myCustomEvents</b>.</li>
	<li><b>Message Handlers</b> - Message handlers are used to process server side messages sent in JSON format. This shall be a convenient
	mechanism to build custom Ajax applications. More details can be found in <a href="#" class="tab" rel="t6">Messaging Tab</a></li>
	<li><b>Custom Controls</b> - You need to register the selectors and initialization methods with arguments to make all control-specific HTML
	segments dynamically loaded with modules into active controls. Simply add a line in function <b>myControls</b> and Voila, your custom controls
	are activated. Further instructions can be found in <a href="modules/m406.html" class="local">module 406</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Navigation Tab</b> - Last not least, the navigation tab is also customizable, further instructions in
	<a href="modules/m501.html" class="local">module 501</a>.</li>
</ul>
