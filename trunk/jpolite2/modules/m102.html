<h3>Unchanged Philosophy</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Less is more</b> - The core still remains small and handy, only 3K minimized. Yet it can be extended and customized to included more features easily.</li>
	<li><b>Separation of Concern</b> - Unobtrusive JavaScript, content independent Grid system, content & template in HTML.</li>
	<li><b>Convention over configuration</b> - Convention is advised but not enforced, you can follow the defaults and have a nicely working system, or customize radically and build your super site.</li>
	<li><b>It is easier to make simple things better than making better things simple</b> - It's still simple, and ways to make it better are included.</li>
</ul>
<p>The target of this framework is to provide a <b>handy</b> tool for easy content integration. Yet I believe it is <b>powerful</b> enough to serve as cornerstone for more advanced portals.
